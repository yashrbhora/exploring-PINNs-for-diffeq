<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Include a section 1 “introduction” that describes the main question that you are asking in
  your project. It should describe the problem that you are taking on that builds on the
  paper.
</p>

<h2>Paper Review</h2>
<p>Physics-informed Neural Networks by Raussi et al. presents a method of using neural networks to solve
  differential equations by introducing the mathematical constraints as a regularization agent in the loss function.
  This prior information serves to shrink the solution space of the network, enabling it to quickly learn a generalized
  function that obeys the given laws. Generalization is of increased importance in the context of complex biological and
  physical domains, which are often plagued by low amounts of training data. The authors demonstrate the method by
  applying PINNs to notable problems such as Schrodingers equation and the Allen-Cahn equation. In these cases, PINNs
  are able to generate accurate predictions of the non-linear behavior despite the small data sets. The level of
  performance in these predictions is especially impressive when considering the relative simplicity in the
  implementation of PINNs.
</p>
<p>Though, as the authors recognize, PINNs are not a comprehensive replacement to classical methods. Rather, they offer
  alternative paths to solving partial differential equations with new features such as parameterization and transfer
  learning, which can outweigh analytical techniques in specific domains. In our case...
</p>

<h2>Technical Structure</h2>

<p>Include a section 3 that describes the technical structure of your method or
  implementation. This should be brief, no more than one screenful of webpage text. You
  may also include an architectural figure in addition to the text.. Include a pointer to the
  code to your implementation.
</p>

<h2>Results</h2>

<p>Include a section 4 that reports your experimental findings. This should include graphs or
  images that visualize the results that you have obtained.
</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Include a section 5 that has one paragraph to summarize your conclusions, including
  any implications for applications or impacts on society, or ideas for future work.
