<h2>An Analysis of Physics-informed Neural Networks for Differential Equations</h2>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model is an epidemiological model used to evaluate and predict the spread
  of infectious diseases within a population. The model consists of three ordinary differential equations:
</p>

<p>The Susceptible Equation: $$\frac{dS}{dt} = \frac{-\beta S(t) I(t)}{{N}}$$</p>

<p>The Infected Equation: $$\frac{dS}{dt} = \frac{\beta S(t) I(t)}{N} - \gamma I(t)$$</p>

<p>The Recovered Equation: $$\frac{dS}{dt} = \gamma I(t)$$</p>

<p>This project aims to apply physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to the SIR equations. By introducing mathematical
  constraints from the differential equations in the loss function, the neural network is able to better generalize to
  the behavior of the system. The accurate prediction of the SIR model can offer insights into the duration of an
  outbreak, the total number of infections, and the peak of an outbreak. This information is vital for healthcare
  officials to determine the appropriate allocation of resources during a crisis, which can ultimately save lives.</p>


<h2>Paper Review</h2>
<p>Physics-informed Neural Networks by Raussi et al. presents a method of using neural networks to solve
  differential equations by introducing the mathematical constraints as a regularization agent in the loss function.
  This prior information serves to shrink the solution space of the network, enabling it to quickly learn a generalized
  function that obeys the given laws. Generalization is of increased importance in the context of complex biological and
  physical domains, which are often plagued by low amounts of training data. The authors demonstrate the method by
  applying PINNs to notable problems such as Schrodingers equation and the Allen-Cahn equation. In these cases, PINNs
  are able to generate accurate predictions of the non-linear behavior despite the small data sets. The level of
  performance in these predictions is especially impressive when considering the relative simplicity in the
  implementation of PINNs.
</p>
<p>Though, as the authors recognize, PINNs are not a comprehensive replacement to classical methods. Rather, they offer
  alternative paths to solving partial differential equations with new features such as parameterization and transfer
  learning, which can outweigh analytical techniques in specific domains. In our case, we choose to apply PINNs to the
  SIR model to predict the dynamics of disease spread within a population. PINNs can offer better generalization if
  the epidemiological data has considerable noise or is sparse. The flexibility of PINNs also allows it to be used in
  inverse problems, such as estimating model parameters.

<h2>Technical Structure</h2>

<p>Include a section 3 that describes the technical structure of your method or
  implementation. This should be brief, no more than one screenful of webpage text. You
  may also include an architectural figure in addition to the text.. Include a pointer to the
  code to your implementation.
</p>

<h2>Results</h2>

<p>Include a section 4 that reports your experimental findings. This should include graphs or
  images that visualize the results that you have obtained.
</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>As shown above, the application of PINNs to the SIR equations generates substantial improvements over basic neural
  network architectures. By informing the loss function with prior information about the system, the model is able to
  better generalize to the long-term behavior of the disease spread. The increased accuracy in modeling these equations
  can provide policymakers with valuable knowledge about the future state of the population. In the future, this work
  could be further progressed by applying PINNs to more complicated epidemiological equations such as the SEIR or SEIRS
  models.
